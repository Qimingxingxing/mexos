% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\section{Introduction}
This document is the writeup of our 6.824 final project.

The goals of the project are:

\section{Design} \label{sec:design}

\subsection{Paxos Optimizations}

\subsection{Persistent Storage}

\subsubsection{Recovery from failures}

\section{Performance}

We created an extensive system to try and accurately measure performance. In addition to writing many benchmarks, we also modified the original RPC system so that we could run the servers in an AWS cluster and observe the performance on a real network. 

\subsection{Throughput and Latency}

\subsection{Bottlenecks}
Although we made significant improvements performance-wise, we identified a number of bottlenecks.

\subsubsection{Paxos}

\subsubsection{Disk Recovery}

\section{Conclusion}
We did a project.

%\section{\\Appendix A: Alternative Emergency Alert Scheme}
% the \\ insures the section title is centered below the phrase: Appendix B
% See Appendix A for  (NOTE: perhaps the base station could note the empty 
%space, and then take advantage of the periodicity to send a broadcast packet 
%that would allow sensors to opportunistically fill in the blank, thus 
%increasing the success rate).(NOTE: opportunistic make up listed in last note
%could allow for the two sensors to randomly switch to open slots, potentially
% getting rid of the collision state). (NOTE: unless the fill-in-the-blank
%scheme is uses, in which case the base station will be fully aware of any 
%re-mappings as it dictated them in the first place!).
