This test is a toy RPC system that creates a 1.15GB database and
transfers it to a remote recipient via TCP stream. This test was
created to see how the RPC overhead effects throughput, and it turns
out that the database/disk is actually the real bottleneck.

To run, change the configuration host IPs in the source. 

Set 'fill=false', and then run 'go run server.go'.  Comment out the
code near the bottom if you need to generate a new db.

Then, on the other machine, 'fill = true'  and 'go run server.go'.

The fill flag indicates which server is sending (filling the buffer) and which is receiving.
